Why are we doing this?
I am doing this to gain experience in software development as i plan to enter that sector of business. I have come from a sales background and would like a career change. The bootcamp also mentioned they would give us access to recruiters who would assist in getting us a job in our specified field.

How I expected the challenge to go.
I expected the challenge to be very difficult. It is called a bootcamp for a reason, so i expected it to be very intense. The challenge required us to implement all we learned within a very short time frame which made it even more difficult to complete. Nonetheless it has been a worthwhile experience.

What went well? / What didn't go as planned?
The SQL Database went very well as it was simple and easy to do. Testing however is something that didnt go as planned. It was a very difficult hurdle that was eventually overcome. Getting used to Eclipse was difficult also. I personally had issues where the application did not open at one point and i had to reinstall.

Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.
The obvious improvement would be applying a front end to the project. This was not covered, i believe due to the timeframe. However, the API looks very raw at the moment and i would love to learn some front end development to make my project a lot cleaner and user friendly.

I will attach a word file containing screenshots of:
Postman and Swagger requests and the output from the API will be displayed as an attached file.
Screenshot of my database to prove that data is being persisted.
Screenshot of my test results, including coverage report. 

// (I have included DTO in my project and it runs perfectly fine. However, in order to reach 72.2% coverage i have commented out DTO code that was not being used).
